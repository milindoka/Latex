Illustrated children's books. Primary dependencies: flowfram and extsizes.
Presentations. Primary dependency: beamer.

Limited overs cricket score sheet. Primary dependency: custom class based on article.
Poetry (just part of a creative writing course, so no serious use). Primary dependency: article and verse in most cases, but shapepar in one case with the assistance of flowframtk (for a poem about a dripping tap where each verse was shaped like a drop of water).
